Content aggregators take work, resell it and pay pennies to the creators. \n\nSometimes, even in the small town where I formerly worked, great photography can illuminate, amplify and engage, illustrating issues and concepts in a way words can’t. Sealing for all time a historical record of an instant in the blink of humanity’s collective eye. \n\nI have a dusty box of awards from my 2  decades in photojournalism. They make fine cheese boards. \n\n\nA living wage, even as a full time staffer, is the prize I never found. And many who ply the trade never do to this day. \n\nSociety and specifically democracies need “us”. We are devoted and committed to what “we” do. But the ranks are rapidly shrinking.",

India born CEOs of top US companies Satya Nadela of Microsoft and Pichai Sundararajan of Google. Indian Americans are big beneficiaries of the world class primary, secondary and college education received by super achievers in their motherland. \n\nIt is unfortunate that the elected leaders in India responded to the COVID pandemic in a somewhat haphazard manner to the pandemic but it was with benevolent intentions. Considering it is the second most populated country in the world, India handled the pandemic better than the USA, the distant third most populated country in the world with most number of deaths despite multiple safe and effective vaccines and state of the art standard of care.\n\nIndia is an ancient civilization surviving through several pandemics, foreign invasions and colonial occupations and has resilience beyond our imagination. India schools may have stayed closed for extended periods, but I would not give up on a generation and call the school age children of today a 'lost generation'. Just as the USA is moving towards school choice including home schooling, India has always been a massive class room where education occurs even out of school.",

Jack Ma, the richest Chinese man, disappeared for months just for criticizing the Chinese government's economic policy.  What about ordinary Chinese people ? In India or USA or UK, media criticizes their respective governments everyday, but you can only dream such things in an autocracy.  Democracy might not make a country a global power, but it gives basic freedom that every human deserves. \nFinally, Mao, the Chinese leader, with his flawed policies, was responsible for the death of tens of millions Chinese.  That's not possible in USA, UK or India because they are Democracies. Democracy is not perfect, in fact far from perfect, but it's much better than autocracy  / monarchies.",

There is no way the government of India could accurately account for the number of Indians who contracted the virus and died.  Millions of Indians still live on the streets and in villages unaccounted for.  Yes I know India has modernized in the last 60 years, but friends who have gone back to visit their sites recently within the last 5 years tell me the cities have changed , but the small towns and villages are pretty much like they were 60 years ago.  There were 500 million people in India in 1970.  Today over one billion.",

It’s a horrific choice, to be sure, but sometimes there are only bad options on the table.\n\nWe chose to prioritize the old — those who, generally speaking, already got to live a life. To do so, we’ve robbed our younger generations in so many ways that they will never fully recover from.\n\nThis might be horrible to say, but our elderly should have fallen on the proverbial grenade so that our youth didn’t have to. Someone had to take the blast; it shouldn’t be these children.",

You people critical of boomers should ask what prompted that change. \nI felt and still feel, that we need to have hard conversations about end of life health care for the elderly. But most boomers are in our 60s, still working, or actively retired, or contributing to the economy. I hope you aren’t saying we should all die on behalf of your kids.",

The government has to spend enormous amount of money on weapons and military to fend off terrorists from Pakistan and Bangladesh, and keep China at bay. This is not new. Since the 1980’s \nweapons given to Pakistan have been found in Kashmir targeting India. Imagine all the kids who could have been nourished and educated. \nSo a chronic problem has become dire. India was making steady progress for several years before the pandemic reversed all the gains. My heart goes out to India.",
